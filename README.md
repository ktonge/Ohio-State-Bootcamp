# Processing Kickstarter Data with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was intended to introduce me as a student to additional excel concepts.  This project was an exploration of data, being able to transofrm it into new data, and effectively expressing that data through graphics.  
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to explore the relationship between campaign launch date, fundraising goals, and success if any.  We worked with up and coming playright Louise, to follow up to her successful kickstarter.  We were looking to put her experience in the context of other kickstarters. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We started by focusing on comparing other similar works to Louise’s, we narrowed the Kickstarter data initially to focus on theater projects and how they were affected by launch date. Our first analysis looked specifically at outcomes compared to the month of the year the campaign was started in.  The image below shows successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters, and the month in which they started.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We also looked more broadly at goal size and what percentage of projects were successful,failed, or canceled.   We created new categories to organize goals into ranges from $999 or less, increasing in $4999 increments, to projects with goals of $50000 or more 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This data set did not have date information in a way that was accessible to excel. To find this information we did have to translate date information from an Apex to recognizable format.
## Results
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to our data set, we say a spike in May with successful campaigns.  The most successful campaigns start in May, with that number steadily dropping until September.  The lowest number of successful campaigns started in December. Looking at this information, there was no point in the year as per our data where there were more failed projects that successful projects.  Based on the data we reviewed, most successful kickstarter campaigns for theater are started in May.  Between May and September is the most successful time of the year to start a kickstarter for theater, with December being the time where projects are more likely to fail.  This makes sense with the focus that fundraising receives around winter holidays, especially when Theater is competing against charitable giving.  
### Outcomes based on Goals
The lower the goal, the more likely a project was to succeed. Generally we saw an inverse relationship between goal and success. For projects with goals between $10000 and $35000 we saw more failures than successes.  We saw that there were a sharp decline in the percentage of projects that succeeded starting at $40000 and dropping to its lowest point at $50000 or more. 
### Limitations
Some limitations of this data set are its size, meaning it covered many types of kickstarters that weren't relavent to Louise's inquiry. Others are also more generally limitations to Kickstarter's ability to collect data.  For example, the Compass Players requested in their blurb requested backers donate on external websites.  "Shakespeare Orange County's HAMLET: Match This!" advertised that their goal was to match a grant.  It would be interested to see which theater organizations had external funding, as well as a greater breakdown of theater in the United States by state.  
### Further Research
Other possible areas of interest for Louise using this data set would be comparing average contribution to goal as well as success/failure/cancellation rate.
